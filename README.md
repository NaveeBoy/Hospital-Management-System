                                       Hospital Management System 

Developed a robust Hospital Management System using Java with NetBeans and XAMPP. This application 
streamlines hospital operations by managing patient records, appointments, billing, and medical inventories. The 
system ensures efficient data management and accessibility for hospital staff, improving overall operational 
efficiency and patient care. This project highlights my proficiency in Java and my ability to develop comprehensive 
management solutions tailored to healthcare environments.
